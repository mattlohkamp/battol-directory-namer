- [] **consistent naming** replace 'folder' with 'directory' globally
- [] **typing** convert codebase to typescript, remove redundant JSDOC
- [] **testing** unit testing, especially in util funcs
- [] **testing** api mocks
- [] **consistent typing** evaluate usage of null versus undefined throughout (undefined is incidentally nothing, null is nothing on purpose?)
